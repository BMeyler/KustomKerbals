KustomKerbals
=============

A small mod for KSP that allows users to edit kerbals in-game.

Have you ever wanted to add yourself into the game? Do you think leaving the game every single time you want to create a new kerbal is tedious?

Well then this is the mod for you! Kustom Kerbals allows you to add new kerbals to your game, ready to be shot off into space! You can edit all of the features of this kerbal, be it his name, bravery or stupidity, you can change it all! You can even make him a Badassâ„¢ like Jebediah! Once you're done editing your kerbal, click "Kreate" to add him to your available flight crew.



HOW TO USE:

1) In the upper left corner of the space center, click "open kustomizer".
2) Choose the new kerbal's name, courage, stupidity and badassness.
3) Click "Kreate Kerbal".
4) Put your new kerbal in a rocket from the crew tab in the VAB.
***Be sure to move the window off of the buildings, so that you don't accidentally open the VAB***

INSTALLATION:

1) Be sure to remove any KustomKerbals folder from your Gamedata folder.
2) Extract the contents of the .ZIP file into your KSP root directory, merging as needed.
3) Play KSP!

TO-DO LIST:

See the Dev Thread. (Also check there before posting a suggestion)

KNOWN BUGS:

*In the Astronaut complex, Stupidity and Courage will show as 100%. The kerbal will still have the settings you chose, but they do not display properly.*

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Before posting a bug report, follow these steps:

1) Start with a fresh install of KSP. No mods, no nothing. Re-install if necessary.
2) Install ONLY Kustom Kerbals. --- Follow one of the three options below.
--- If the error does not occur and you were not using any other mods, continue playing.
--- If the error does not occur and you were using other mods, go to step 3.
--- If the error occurs again, go to step 5.
3) Install all the other mods you were using, 1 by 1, launching KSP each time. When you encounter the error, go to step 4
4) Launch KSP using only the mod that you found in step 3.
--- If the error occurs with only that mod installed, go bug the creator of that mod.
--- If the error occurs only when that mod AND Kustom Kerbals are installed together, go to step 5.
5) Post your error log on something like pastebin, then add a link here. Be sure to describe the problem in detail, and if it is caused by using Kustom Kerbals with another mod, tell me the name of the other mod.

CHANGELOG:

Version 1.0:

-Initial release;
-Added the ability to add kerbals with custom parameters from in-game.
